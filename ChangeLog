TODOs:

- (1) Make the library robust to removed nodes or edges.
- (4) Implement decoding method ICM with restarts.
- (3) Implement exact (brute force) decoding method.
- (2) Implement some approximated method for inference.
- (3) Implement exact (brute force) inference method.
- (3) Make the libray robust when dealing with nodes and edges of different types.
- (2) Study and implement how to hallucinate objects and obtain their most probable location.


Alpha 0.0.2 (17-02-14):
- Huge refactoring: The project has been split into a few libraries: base, training and decoding by the moment, but it is probable that the inference one will be added in the future.
- An example of the use of the library for training has been created.
- Now decoding methods can return the negative-log-likelihood of the result as well as the cause of stopping iterating.
- libLBFGS added as dependency for training PGMs.
- Development of the basic functinoality for training a PGM.
- Documentation improved.


Alpha 0.0.1 (13-02-14):
- Added two methods for decoding: ICM and GreedyICM.
- Implemented basic data structures for building a PGM, namely: nodes and edges.
